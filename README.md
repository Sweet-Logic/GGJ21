![My image](https://github.com/Sweet-Logic/GGJ21/blob/main/Resources/GGJ21_CoverImage.jpg?raw=1)

You're late! You've woken up late for work and need to gather your things quickly before you leave. You have 60 seconds to search around your house for the items you've lost and find them before the timer runs out. Grab items by pressing space and drop items by pressing F. Make sure to check your objectives in the top left hand corner to help you decide what items to take with you but be careful, you only have enough space to take four things with you.

## Contols

## Future of this project
Currently we are both in our final year of our course and as such wont be focusing too much on the continued development of this project in the short term. 
However we both think that this game is not complete and are intending to continue the project when we have some more spare time.
